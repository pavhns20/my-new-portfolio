      <p>With the current Dan Murphy's website being so confusing to use, it was no surprise that users were still
        shopping in-store.
        One other main reason that was that shoppers enjoyed the the experience of reading the labels and touching the
        products as they shopped.

    <div>
      <p class="take">At the beginning of this project I stated that I wanted to be involved in both research and
        design.<br><br>

        I wasn't very experienced using Figma (which was our design tool for this project), however I feel like I had
        seriously improved by the end of the project.
        The hi-fi prototype was my own work and I am very proud of what I achieved and how I had managed to up-skill in
        4 days.<br><br>
        Also, the benefit of having early sketches that relate to the research to iterate from would have made the
        design process much easier- getting the design right and the right design certainly came to mind on this
        project. This was a great lesson!</p>
