      <p>With the current Dan Murphy's website being so confusing to use, it was no surprise that users were still

        One other main reason that was that shoppers enjoyed the the experience of reading the labels and touching the
        products as they shopped.

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="take">At the beginning of this project I stated that I wanted to be involved in both research and
        design.<br><br>

        I wasn't very experienced using Figma (which was our design tool for this project), however I feel like I had
        seriously improved by the end of the project.
        The hi-fi prototype was my own work and I am very proud of what I achieved and how I had managed to up-skill in
        4 days.<br><br>
        Also, the benefit of having early sketches that relate to the research to iterate from would have made the
        design process much easier- getting the design right and the right design certainly came to mind on this
        project. This was a great lesson!</p>
