				<h2>Key learnings</h2>

				<p>
					At the start of this project I stated that I wanted to be involved in
					both research and design.<br />

					I had only just started using Figma (which was our design tool),
					however I feel like I had seriously improved by the end of the
					project. The hi-fi prototype was my own work and I am very proud of
					what I achieved and how I had managed to up-skill in 4 days.<br />
					Also, the benefit of having early sketches that relate to the research
					to iterate from would have made the design process much easier-
					getting the design right and the right design certainly came to mind
					on this project.
