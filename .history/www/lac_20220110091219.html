				<h2>Key learnings</h2>
				<p>
					Although a hi-fi fidelity prototype wasn't one of the requested
					deliverables, when we tested with SME's, it seemed that they really
					appreciated having a tangible product to interact with.<br />
					I felt that by offering them the prototype to interact with they could
					actually understand how the Luxury Access Club website would work &
					this might not have been quite so clear when running usability testing
					with them if we only had a lo-fi prototype to offer them.
