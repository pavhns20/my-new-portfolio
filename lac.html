      <h2>About The Project</h2>
      <p>Over 4 weeks, myself and my fellow team member were charged with researching and validating the need for the
        new Luxury Access Club website.<br><br>
        We focused on designing a responsive website that will offer affordable, accessible luxury to users via single
        day pass access or membership option, so that they will be able to experience what luxury hotels have to offer
        without having to be an in-house guest.</p>

      <h2>Who is Our Audience?</h2>
      <p>With some interviews already completed, by our client it was evident that our target audience was people in
        their
        30's- according to those findings, people in their 30's are far more likely to pay for comfort & luxury when
        travelling.

        One potential problem with these findings was that all of those interviewed had, in some way, a connection to
        our
        client so we felt that we needed to dive deeper to validate Luxury Access Club with no potential biases.</p>

    <h3>2 Journeys, Same Outcome</h3>
    <p>Our journey map shows the two different paths our users would travel whilst using the
      Luxury Access Club website.
      One purchasing membership, the other a single use
      day pass.<br>
      From our research, the main concern that people had was whether they might be treated differently or that they may
      have to wear a wristband-which would only compound their feelings of being treated differently to in-house
      guests.</p>

      <h2>Client Feedback </h2>
      <p>Our project brief from the client was to research and validate the viability of Luxury Access Club as a
        potential
        new venture.<br> At the beginning of this project we were told that "design would be considered a plus", but we
        were
        determined to make that happen.
        On presenting the hi-fi prototype, the client was impressed by what we were able to deliver within the
        designated timeframe.</p>

    <div class="thanks">
      <img class="openquotes" src="images/openquotesnew.svg" alt="open quote symbol">
      <p><em>Thank you for all that you've put together with this project. Also thank you for your professionalism
          with
          everyone that you interviewed on behalf of Luxury Access Club-everyone that I've spoken to were really
          happy
          to
          work with you & your chat.</em></p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Although a hi-fi fidelity prototype wasn't one of the requested deliverables, when we tested with SME's, it
      seemed that they really appreciated having a tangible product to interact with.
      I felt that by offering them the prototype to interact with they could actually understand how the Luxury Access
      Club website would work & this might not have been quite so clear when running usability testing with them if we
      only had a lo-fi prototype to offer them.</p>
